### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm John Paolo Desuasido!
As a Mathematics major who specializes in the field of Computer Science, I aspire to develop my critical and problem-solving capacities in the extent of applying it in the field of computer technology and software engineering. Most of the files found in my repositories are my works and corresponding contributions to my group in fulfillment of the requirements for our courses.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my confidence in coding and software programming, for I am more exposed in the theoretical aspect of mathematical logic.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and refining my skills on various programming languages, as well as sharpening my problem-solving skills.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: My hobbies are playing games, watching computer and mobile tech-related videos, and playing piano! :musical_keyboard:
